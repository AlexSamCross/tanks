TO DO

- StatusBar, so players know when it's their turn.
- A Ready 'button' which the current player presses to then reveal their location on the map (this stops the player who's just taken their
turn from learning their opponents location after they've had their go)
- Round Result Component: Shows the result of each round (maybe we could add little explosion sound effects if a player has been hit??)


PlayingField Component
- Needs to create dynamic grid size based on number of players signed up for the game.
- Needs to know who's turn it is to generate tank position when READY button is clicked by a player.
- Eventually needs to update score after each round (when every player in the game has taken a turn)
- Should keep track of each 'tile' and it's state. eg: tile B2 has a hit marker from Player 1 and tile A4 has a position marker from Player 1 etc

THURSDAY SESSION

- Get the grid to produce dynamic size based on players. Agree on size? 2 players = 3x3, 3p = 5x5, 4p = 7x7
SHOW MINE and then let someone lead it?
